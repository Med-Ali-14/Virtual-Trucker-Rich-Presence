Thank you for installing Virtual Trucker Rich Presence!

VT-RPC is an easy tool to let others see your current job, truck, etc. using Discord Rich Presence!  

Here's our Discord server for support: https://discord.gg/Zt49WDH  

Your image will change on the rich presence depending if your lights are on.  
ETCARS 0.15.386 is required for the RPC to work, older versions will not work.  
THIS VERSION INCLUDES ETCARS 0.15.386, YOU MUST DO A FULL INSTALL FOR THIS TO WORK


Things to note!

* TruckersMP has their own Rich Presence which needs to be disabled in MP Settings!

* Due to a few problems with previous ETCARS, you will need to install ETCARS 0.15.386 from our installer.

* IF YOU HAVE ETCARS older than 0.15.386 INSTALLED, PLEASE REINSTALL IT WITH ONE INCLUDED WITH VT-RPC!
